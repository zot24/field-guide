###What we're trying to do
In a connected world there is no such thing as eCommerce, there is only commerce. If your system can connect to the internet, if your system manages stock, if your system sells things, it should be powered by Moltin. Simple as that.

No one should be in denial about the scope of our project, we’re here to change everything about commerce.

###Who do we work for?
We do not work for governments, our investors, or ourselves, we work for our users, they are our most important asset.

###Organisation
Organisation is often something that happens, rather than something that is planned. At Moltin we’re trying hard to keep a very flat structure. We’ve spent too many years in other companies having more bosses to account to than feet on the ground, and we generally found that in-efficient and frustrating.

One week you may find you’re leading a small team, the next week you may be taking a back seat whilst someone else is calling the shots. As features and projects roll by we expect to find different people taking a driving seat depending on their skills or passion for that unit of work.

Of course some people like to lead more than others and that’s fine, we should all be happy to be fluid in that respect.

###Ethos
We don’t like to make many rules, but we have a few simple tenets we try to work by:

 - **Accept New Ideas**. Everyone and anything should be open to new ideas about work processes, structure, best practices, conventions etc… If we’re all open and embrace new things we can’t overlook great ideas when they do come around.
 - **Don’t be an asshole**. Pretty simple.
 - **Work hard**. We’re in an undeniable position. Its going to be hard work, but it will be fun. Accept that, embrace it, hard work has its own rewards, it also brings teams closer, makes achievements sweeter, and makes the times when you can relax all the better.
 - **Work smart**. If you’re performing repetitive, time consuming tasks, you might be doing something wrong. Always ask yourself, “Am I working smart?”

Remember stagnation can be a killer, everyone should be open to change. The more fluid we are the quicker we can react to new scenarios, expand, learn and thrive.
