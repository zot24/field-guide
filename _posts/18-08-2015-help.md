Sometimes we all need a bit of help, especially when you’re in a new environment. Help can come in many forms, perhaps you can’t connect to the internet? Perhaps you’ve lost your favourite pen? Or perhaps you feel like you’re struggling with a concept or workload.

A few words of advice in some of the more serious situations you might need help in.

 - **Be calm**, relax, think. if you’re working with us, it’s because we like you and we think you can do it!
 - **Take a break**, have a cup of tea, step outside, talk to someone, have a think logically and figure out your next step.

Don’t bottle it up. Don’t sweep it under the carpet. Be honest. Be open. We’re all here to help each other, if you’re having a tough time with anything talk to someone.
What if I mess up?
We don’t penalise people for making a mistake, it wouldn’t be beneficial for anyone. Most mistakes can be repaired, and it’s important we build an environment where the freedom to fail is enabled.

The biggest mistake you can make is not learning from the previous one, that’s when we know we have a problem. So always be keen to test your ideas, but don’t ignore evidence or rush for the sake of it. Be careful, take advice and learn from past errors.
