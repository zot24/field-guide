###Laptops: Security and Safety
The majority of the team use OSX, some of you may prefer to use another OS, there are a few simple points we like to remind people of:

 - Be choosy about major updates. Sometimes they can cause issues with third party tools, check with others when upgrading and don't rush headlong halfway through an important project, you could lose precious time or actually lose some work.
 - **Encrypt your machine**
 - **Have a password**
 - We advise you keep any personal and work accounts seperate, information should not be leaked between the two.
 - **Stickers** We don't mind if you'd like to adhorn your work laptop with stickers, but you will be forced to remove them if you part with your laptop :)

Please try to look after any hardware you're given. Ultimately we'd love for it to stay with you for a very long time, but that is not always the case, and sometimes someone else might have to use your beloved machines when you are finished with them. Here's some things laptops do and don't like:

 - They **don't** like liquids...
 - They **do** like being kept clean
 - They **don't** like creatures crawling into their vents
 - They **do** like clean and tidy file structures with regular maintenance

###Infrastructure
“The basic physical and organizational structures and facilities (e.g. buildings, roads, power supplies) needed for the operation of a society or enterprise.”

Infrastructure is the physical aspect of our delivery. Its the servers, databases, load balancers and programs that govern how our software is delivered to the end user. Infrastructure is a constantly changing battlefield. Many factors including security, latency, load and more contribute to decisions made in infrastructure.

As a basic rule we like everyone to understand the following:

 - Our infrastructure is worldwide.
 - Our infrastructure is built on Amazon Web Services.
 - Our infrastructure is the base we build on and is super important.

Infrastructure is covered more heavily in the technical handbook.
