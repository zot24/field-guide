###Infrastructure
“The basic physical and organizational structures and facilities (e.g. buildings, roads, power supplies) needed for the operation of a society or enterprise.”

Infrastructure is the physical aspect of our delivery. Its the servers, databases, load balancers and programs that govern how our software is delivered to the end user. Infrastructure is a constantly changing battlefield. Many factors including security, latency, load and more contribute to decisions made in infrastructure.

As a basic rule we like everyone to understand the following:

 - Our infrastructure is worldwide.
 - Our infrastructure is built on Amazon Web Services.
 - Our infrastructure is the base we build on and is super important.

Infrastructure is covered more heavily in the technical handbook.
