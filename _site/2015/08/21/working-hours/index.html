<p>We have a liberal approach to working hours. We do however ask for the first 3-6 months you attain a normal 9 to 5 working pattern. This is so we can get you up to speed with the company and whatever part of it you’ll be working in. Once you’ve settled in, you’ll find your office hours become more malleable.</p>

<p>Every now and then people wish to push themselves a bit further and put in more than the usual hours. While this is great for a deadline, if this is happening regularly it’s a sign that something isn’t working correctly. We spend a lot of time hiring the right people who can strike a good balance between work and life outside.</p>

<p>If you find yourself working too many hours, you should mention it so it can be addressed.</p>

<h3 id="illness">Illness</h3>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="s2">&quot;If everyone who got the common cold was quarantined,</span>
<span class="s2">we&#39;d wipe it out in a few years.&quot;</span></code></pre></div>

<p>If you’re ill, stop trying to look like a hero, We don’t want your flu-ridden body shuffling around the office like a semi-animated corpse.</p>

<p>We also don’t want other people being infected by you.</p>

<p>Let the team know in slack, and pick up your work from anywhere other than where the main team is!</p>
