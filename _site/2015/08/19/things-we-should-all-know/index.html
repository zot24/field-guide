<h3 id="infrastructure">Infrastructure</h3>
<p>“The basic physical and organizational structures and facilities (e.g. buildings, roads, power supplies) needed for the operation of a society or enterprise.”</p>

<p>Infrastructure is the physical aspect of our delivery. Its the servers, databases, load balancers and programs that govern how our software is delivered to the end user. Infrastructure is a constantly changing battlefield. Many factors including security, latency, load and more contribute to decisions made in infrastructure.</p>

<p>As a basic rule we like everyone to understand the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Our infrastructure is worldwide.</li>
  <li>Our infrastructure is built on Amazon Web Services.</li>
  <li>Our infrastructure is the base we build on and is super important.</li>
</ul>

<p>Infrastructure is covered more heavily in the technical handbook.</p>
